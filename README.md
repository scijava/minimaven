# MiniMaven

MiniMaven is a minimal build system interpreting Maven-style pom.xml files. It
is intended as a drop-in replacement for Maven to build Fiji, ImageJ2 and *very*
simple Java projects.

Originally maintained as part of [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/) as a successor to the
Fiji Build System, it migrated to [ImageJ2](http://developer.imagej.net/) and
subsequently to the [SciJava](http://scijava.github.io/) family of projects. Its
primary purpose is now to support the SciJava scripting framework ("Java as a
scripting language").
